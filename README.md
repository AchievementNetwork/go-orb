This orb provides a convenient set of commands that work with the
Achievement Network
[common make infrastructure for GoLang](https://github.com/AchievementNetwork/common-make) version 1.2.0 and higher.

Examples of usage can be found in the `src/examples` directory.

## Access

The source code for this Orb is public due to the need to interact
with CircleCI.  It is not expected to be used outside of the
Achievement Network engineering team though, and may become private
in the future.
